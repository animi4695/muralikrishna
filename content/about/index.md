My name is Murali Krishna, you can call me *Murali*. Iâ€™ve been professionally designing, developing and deploying scalable modern web applications to production for over four years. I am currently coding at [Zenoti](https://www.zenoti.com/company/about-us]) and have previously worked [Aggne](https://aggne.com/) and [AxiomIO](https://axiomio.com/). Would like to know more about me? check out my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fd-q8xZOV4OgLKH8qwraYkmCXh1AR7Rl/view?usp=sharing)

This space lets you know about my thoughts, personal projects, opinions and mild insomnia.
