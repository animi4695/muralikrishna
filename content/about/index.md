My name is Murali Krishna, you can call me *Murali*. Iâ€™ve been professionally designing, developing and deploying scalable modern web applications to production for over four years. I am currently a Master's student at Georgia Institute of Technology Specializing in Interactive Intelligence (a blend of Human-Computer Interaction and AI-ML) . I previously coded at [Zenoti - a wellness industry unicorn](https://www.zenoti.com/company/about-us]), [Aggne](https://aggne.com/) and [AxiomIO](https://axiomio.com/). Would like to know more about me? check out my [resume](/docs/muralik_resume.pdf)

This space lets you know about my thoughts, personal projects, opinions and mild insomnia.
