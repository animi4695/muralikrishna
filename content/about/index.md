My name is Murali Krishna, you can call me *Murali*. Iâ€™ve been professionally designing, developing and deploying scalable modern web applications to production for over four years. I am currently coding at [Aggne](https://aggne.com/) and have previously worked at its sister company [AxiomIO](https://axiomio.com/). Would like to know more about me? check out my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12I0hMQMrSYvvpmVTNCGnSHELo1QzvXSn/view?usp=sharing)

This space lets you know about my thoughts, personal projects, opinions and mild insomnia.
