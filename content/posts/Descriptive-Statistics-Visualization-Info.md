**2 most important functions of descriptive statistics:**

- Communicate Information
- Support reasoning about data

When data is large, it is essential to use summaries.

#### Graphical summaries of data

Many ways to visualize data.

- for data that is **qualitative** (e.g. colors, cart types, ...) use a pie chart (good for percentages) or dot plot (good for showing numbers)

- for data that is **quantitative** (i.e. numbers), use **Bar graph**. (Basically a dot plot put on its side). **Histogram** allows to use blocks with different widths.

- 2 kinds of information can be drawn out of histogram.
  - **Density (crowding):** height of bar tells how many subjects there are for one unit on horizontal scale. 
  - **Percentages (relative frequencies):** area = height * width
