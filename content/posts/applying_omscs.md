I got accepted into the master's program in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology. I will be moving to US for my further studies at Gatech starting from August'23. Below are someone of the questions I asked myself numerous times and got questioned by others. 

**Why Masters leaving a cushy job?**

With the changing dynamics in the current tech industry. I felt it is the need of hour to reskill myself to stay upto date with latest trends. I did a project related to Machine Learning during my undergrad in 2017. At that time, AI/ML/DataScience were just buzz words and it has risen so much in the recent times that I sometimes wonder what would've happened if I continued pursuing in that field after my undergrad. Few people asked why leave a cushy job when you can learn from internet. I tried it for sometime but didn't feel like I'm giving my 100%. I hope I prove myself that I made the right decision. We will find out soon...

**Why Georgia Tech?**

It has an OMSCS (Online Masters in CS) program almost similar to oncampus one. They even give the same degree. My thought process was to keep it as a backup plan incase I wanted to come back to India and join back the Industry. On top of that, Georgia Tech is a wellknown university with top 10 ranking in CS. There were other couple of options from UT-Austin, Carnegie but the credits were not transferrable.

**Plan after Masters**

Work at a company for 4-5 years related to general software engineering, if possible build a product that reaches atleast a 100 users. Move back to India hopefully. Other than this haven't thought much. Surprises are better.
