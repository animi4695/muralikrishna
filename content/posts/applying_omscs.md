#### What is OMCS?
Georgia Tech is a top tier university that needs no introduction. It has collabarated with AT&T and created a course equivalent to an on-campus degree. OMSCS is short for Online Masters of Science in Computer Science. The name online is just the mode of teaching and is nothing lower compared to the oncampus course. Infact they even give the same degree that is given to the oncampus students. This post is for someone who is on the verge of making a decision whether to apply or not. Also, I have tried to answer questions/confusions that crossed my mind while filling out the application.

**Is OMSCS for you?** 

It is a personal question one should ask for themselves; But I can honestly give my reasons for choosing OMCS. Firstly, I was bored with routine offce work which made me felt like computer science is more than these latest frameworks. Secondly, I coudln't afford a debt to travel to US and enroll in a US university. Also, other minimal reasons include a special quota for visa - incase I get a chance to work in US, option of transfering to oncampus if I wanted to move towards research (heard, very slim chances), degree from one of the top most university without a huge hole in my pocket, chance to network with huge community and learn to build a better software. 

I'm happy with my earnings in India and was not desperate to settle in US. If that is something you're interested in, I strongly suggest to travel to US, enroll in a decent university & experience the life.
